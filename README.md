# Churn Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning classification techniques.
The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature encoding and scaling
3. Model training using classification algorithms
4. Model evaluation
5. Saving trained model

## Dataset
Dataset sourced from Kaggle – Customer Churn Dataset.
(The dataset is not uploaded due to repository best practices.)

## Files in this Repository
- `churn_prediction.py` – Main Python script
- `churn_model.pkl` – Trained ML model

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for churn prediction.
